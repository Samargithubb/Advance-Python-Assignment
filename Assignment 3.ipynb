    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "Ans. An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other\n",
    "classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any\n",
    "child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more\n",
    "abstract methods is called an abstract class.\n",
    "whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have \n",
    "an implementation\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "class Polygon(ABC): #Abstract Class\n",

    "Ans. when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, its\n",

    "and exists for as long as the function is existing.\n",
